 This repository was used to organize a group project for my university. The project was a scale that used arduino and a variety of sensors to serve as a platform for
regular users to keep track of their health status, displaying a series of outputs (Body Mass Index, daily caloric intake, daily water intake, basal metabolic rate).
 Our project used mass and ultrassonic sensors alongside of a notebook to input the necessary informations about the user.
